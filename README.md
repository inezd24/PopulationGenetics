# Population Genetics project 2023

Repository for the different analyses used in the project of population genetics with the Raute. I've documented here all analyses that we plan on using, as well as some that we may not use in the end but for which I want to document how I created the pipelines. The repo includes the following

- Using PLINK (1.9 and 2.0) to filter, prune for LD, and wrangle data where necessary
- Examine population genetic structure through allel-frequency-based methods such as PCA and ADMIXTURE
- Compute F-statistics to examine patterns of gene flow and admixture (F3, F3 outgroup, and F4).
- How to phase data with BEAGLE and how to use this data in IBD analyses (hap-IBD and IBDne)
- How to use chromopainter, finestructure, and globetrotter as haplotype-based alternatives to the above-mentioned genetic structure analyses.
